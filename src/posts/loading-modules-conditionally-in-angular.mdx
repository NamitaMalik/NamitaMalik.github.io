# Loading Modules Conditionally in Angular

One of the very common features of Admin dashboard applications is **Access Control**. 
This is usually achieved through a set of permissions. A feature is displayed or hidden from the user depending upon the set of permissions he/she has.
One can build a service or a directive or both to achieve this.

Now, what if user should doesn't have permission to access the complete module? We can off course hide 
all the components belonging to that module from user but wouldn't it be great if we don't even load the 
entire module for that user.

In one of my previous blogs, I had discussed about lazy loading angular modules using routing. 
So let's now extend this feature a bit more and load the modules conditionally i.e. as per user access.

I have a simple Angular application that has 3 modules:

1. `AppModule` - This is the root module of the application.
2. `TasksModule` - Child Module. Comprises of `TasksComponent` and `TasksListComponent`.
3. `UsersModule` - Child Module. Comprises of `UsersComponent` and `UsersListComponent`.

Now, we want only users with permission `View Users` to be able to access users related info.

First, let's quickly review over `AppRoutingModule`. It looks like this:

```TypeScript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import { PreloadAllModules, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      {path: '', redirectTo: '/tasks', pathMatch: 'full'},
      {path: 'tasks', loadChildren: './tasks/tasks.module#TasksModule'},
      {path: 'users', loadChildren: './users/users.module#UsersModule', data: {permission: 'View Users'}
      }
    ], {
      preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules
    })
  ],
  exports: [
    RouterModule
  ]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

Let's create a service which will make a `http request` and fetch the permissions for the logged in user.
For demo purposes, I have taken a hardcoded json in my assets folder. My `app.service.ts` looks as given below:

```TypeScript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AppService {
  availablePermissions: any[];
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
  public load() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      this.http.get<any>('assets/permissions.json')
        .subscribe( (response) => {
        this.availablePermissions = response.availablePermissions;
        resolve(true);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

Now, let's move to our `AppModule`. With respect to this demo, I would want permissions for a user to be 
available before the app is initialized, therefore I do the following:

```
 providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: (appService: AppService) => () => appService.load(),
      deps: [AppService],
      multi: true
    }
  ],
 ```
 
Now, next step is to add a `Route guard` to our application. A route guard supports multiple guard interfaces.
For our case we would need to implement `CanLoad` interface which will mediate navigation to `UsersModule` asynchronously.

```TypeScript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanLoad, Route } from '@angular/router';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanLoad {
  constructor(private appService: AppService) {
  }

  canLoad(route: Route): boolean {
    return this.appService.availablePermissions.indexOf(route.data.permission) !== -1;
  }
}
```

In the above code, we simple created an `AuthGuard` class which implements `CanLoad` interface. In `canLoad` 
function we basically check if the permission needed to access `UsersModule` is available to the user and returns 
a boolean accordingly. You can also return an observable of boolean from the `canLoad` function, which is very
likely in real world applications.

Now, the last part. We need do a minor addition in our `AppRoutingModule` where we have configured our routes.
We will add a `canLoad` property to our route definition for `UsersModule` and provide our `AuthGuard` to it.

```TypeScript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import { PreloadAllModules, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthGuard } from './auth.guard';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      {path: '', redirectTo: '/tasks', pathMatch: 'full'},
      {path: 'tasks', loadChildren: './tasks/tasks.module#TasksModule'},
      {path: 'users', loadChildren: './users/users.module#UsersModule', data: {permission: 'View Users'},
        canLoad: [AuthGuard]}
    ], {
      preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules
    })
  ],
  exports: [
    RouterModule
  ]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

Now, you would notice, even though our `preloadingStrategy` is `PreloadAllModules`, it will load `UsersModule` 
only when our `AuthGuard` returns true. You can also use a custom `preloadingStrategy` if you want to.

Well, that's all for this post. Happy Learning!
